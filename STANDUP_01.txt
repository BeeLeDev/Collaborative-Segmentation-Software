Draft of Requirements
=====================

We need to create an online visualization tool for medical images.

The visualization tool will:
• Handle files ranging from 200MB to - 4.5GB at the same time
• Efficiently quality-check 500+ 3D/4D medical volumes
• Support manual annotations 3D image volumes
• Support a single and multi-user collaborative setting

Technologies Proposed:
• NiiVue to create the web-based visualization tool
• Using python language with medical imaging libraries to run quality checks

Current Questions / Problems / Something you need
=================================================
• How will people access/interact with the program?
• How is the data structured?
• What file types will be uploaded?
• What specific forms of imaging are necessary? 
• What imaging softwares are typical for the medical field?
• How will searching be done?
• Should users be able to download the files with annotations saved?
	• If so what filetype should it be saved as?
